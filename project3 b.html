<img src="C:\Users\HP\Pictures\vanilla cake.jpg" alt="Vanilla Cake" width="400" height="300">
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
 <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans</li>
 <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
 <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
 <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
 <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
 <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk (or 3/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup water)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol type="1">
 <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with
parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.</li>
 <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and
the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as
needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in
3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.</li>
 <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a
toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10
minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool
completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make
them level, if desired.</li>
